In short you need the const bcModSdk line, the const SDK = bcModSdk.registerMod line, 
and something like the SDK.hookFunction line but for the function you're interested in
 
 
But that is only loading your own script. You'd need the SDK in its own file and load that 
(which means an extra HTTP fetch, hence why hard-coding it in the same file is also okay)

.style.backgroundColor = "transparent";
